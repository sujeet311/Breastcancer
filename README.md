# Breastcancer
Breast cancer is one of the most lethal forms of tumors that mostly target the female
population, the classification of malignant (cancerous) and benign (non-cancerous) tumors is
of greater importance in oncology. Numerous data mining techniques have been used, so far
by researchers to aid health care professionals in the diagnosis of a malignant tumor. For this
task, many algorithms have been proposed in the past few years. The aim of this project is to
design a prediction system to identify whether the tumor in the patient’s breast is malignant
or benign using ensemble classification using a voting mechanism. The prediction is made by
analyzing the patient's historic information or data repository. The data used in the project is
the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset (WBCD) available UCL machine-learning repository.
The classifier algorithm, which is tested, is Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor’s,
Decision tree, and Support vector mechanism. The three best classifiers are selected based on
performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall & F1-score) are used for ensemble
classification using a voting mechanism. The voting options used in this project are Hard
voting and Soft voting. Of the above-mentioned algorithm, soft voting with a weighted
average outperformed other algorithms with an accuracy of 98.8 per cent, precision of 100per
cent, recall of 97.0per cent, and f1_score of 98.5 per cent.
